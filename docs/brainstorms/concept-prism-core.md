# Brainstorming: The Prism Core Pivot

> **Date:** December 18, 2024
> **Goal:** Pivot from "clean utility" to "unique brand experience."

---

## The Core Concept: "Refracting Light"
**Problem:** Finance apps are boring (spreadsheets) or cloying (cartoons).
**Solution:** "Futuristic Purity." Technology that feels like magic.
**Visuals:** Glass, Light, Crystals, Gradients.

## Key Features Brainstormed

### 1. The Clarity Ring (Gamification)
**The Hook:**
A "Completionist" mechanic for settling debts.
**Mechanics:**
- **State 1 (Chaos):** Jagged, broken ring. (Unsettled debts).
- **State 2 (Focus):** Connecting segments. (Selecting items).
- **State 3 (Clarity):** Solid, glowing ring. (Settled).
**Why:** Rewards good behavior (paying back) with a satisfying visual "snap."

### 2. Spectral Auras (Personalization / Social)
**The Hook:**
"What does my financial soul look like?"
**Mechanics:**
- User chooses an "Aura" (Gradient palette).
- **Neon:** Pink/Cyan (Cyberpunk).
- **Forest:** Green/Gold (Druid).
- **Ocean:** Teal/Blue (Water).
- **Social Proof:** When I view *your* bill, I see *your* aura.
**Why:** Ownership. Users want to express identity, even in utility apps.

### 3. Gyroscopic Immersion (The "Wow" Factor)
**The Hook:**
"It feels alive in my hand."
**Mechanics:**
- Use the phone's gyroscope to shift background gradients.
- Refraction effect on the "Glass" cards (Balance Prism).
**Why:** Instant premium feel. Differentiates "PrismSplit" from "Splitwise" (static flat UI).

## Rejected Concepts (For Reference)

### Concept 2: "Harmony Garden" (Zen)
- **Idea:** Physics-based balancing scale.
- **Why Rejected:** Too passive? Maybe too abstract for finance? "Prism" creates a stronger, sharper brand identity.

### Concept 3: "Social Pulse" (Feed)
- **Idea:** Instagram Stories for bills. Live activity island.
- **Why Rejected:** Venmo already owns this. Can feel "noisy" and stressful. We want *Clarity*, not *Noise*.

## Next Steps
1.  **Prototype:** Build the Gyroscope Background + Blur View in Expo.
2.  **Asset Gen:** Create the "Jagged vs Smooth" SVG rings for the avatar.
3.  **Theming:** Implement the Aura context provider.
